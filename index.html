					<h1>Fox With Wings</h1>
					<p>I made this for a request that someone made. Fun to make but the wings aren't quite what I wanted them to be.</p>

					<h1>Stretching Cat</h1>
					<p>I wanted to make a silhouette of a cat, but it was hard to see with a dark background, so I added the stars.</p>

					<h1>School Bus</h1>
					<p>I made this for the first contest that I participated in. I like it but I don't like the 2d perspective.</p>
